# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL queries and presenting the insights through data visualization. The dataset used contains information related to the spread and impact of COVID-19 globally.

## Table of Contents


- [SQL Queries](#sql-queries)
- [Data Visualization](#data-visualization)

## Features

- SQL queries for COVID-19 data cleaning and analysis
- Data visualization using Tableau for vaccination trends 
- Exploration of key metrics like confirmed cases, deaths, and vacination
- Comparative analysis across countries and regions

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

- SQL database (for executing SQL queries)
- Tableau Desktop (for viewing Tableau visualizations)

## Usage

To utilize this project, follow these steps:

1. Run the SQL queries in the [sql](/sql) directory against your COVID-19 database to clean and analyze the data.

2. Explore the Tableau visualizations for vaccination trends located in the [tableau_visualizations](/tableau_visualizations) directory.

3. Execute the remaining data visualization scripts located in the [visualization](/visualization) directory using Python.

4. [Provide any additional usage instructions]

## SQL Queries

Explore COVID-19 data through the following SQL queries:

- [Query 1: Cleaning the raw data and preparing it for analysis.]
- [Query 2: Total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries globally.]
- [Query 3: Comparative analysis of cases in specific regions or countries.]
- [Query 4: Identify hotspots and trends over time.]

## Data Visualization

Visualize the analyzed data with the following:

- [Visualization 1: Interactive map of  worldwide.]
- [Visualization 2: Time series plots showing the progression of vacination.]
- [Visualization 3: Tableau visualizations for vaccination trends.]
- [Any other visualizations you've created]
